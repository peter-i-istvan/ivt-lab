[ALREADY DONE]: FiringMode.SINGLE, expected primary fired
[ALREADY DONE]: FiringMode.ALL
1:
	FiringMode.SINGLE twice, expected that both stores get fired once, first primary then secondary
2:
	Primary TS is empty, second is not
	FiringMode.SINGLE is expected to fire the second one
3:
	FiringMode.SINGLE twice, but second store is empty, so we expect the primary to fire twice
4:
	FiringMode.SINGLE once, but the primary store reports failiure, so no TS gets fired at all
5:
	FiringMode.ALL, but primary is empty, so it doesn't get fired
6:
	FiringMode.ALL, but secondary is empty, so it doesn't get fired
